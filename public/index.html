          <br />

        <p><strong>The Ruby on Rails Web Application Framework</strong><br />
Ruby on Rails is  a web development framework, used by some of the worlds biggest internet companies (Twitter, YellowPages, Github, Slideshare, Scribd and HULU to name a few). Ruby on rails is chosen by so many web developers because it makes web development easy and fun. You will learn ruby on rails from scratch in this course, and master the advanced concepts you need to build your own web applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Project Based Learning</strong><br />
After mastering the basics with our tutorials, you'll learn how to apply this theory and use your new skills web applications with practical Projects.</p>
        <p><strong>Test Driven Development.</strong><br />
You'll learn how to test your code continuously with r-spec and produce maintainable code that is easy to scale. </p>
        <p><strong>Advanced Ruby Programming</strong><br />
You'll learn how to write algorithms in ruby to power the complex features in your rails applications with our intensive ruby projects.</p>
        <p><strong>HTML and CSS</strong><br />

        <p><strong>Intensive Learning.</strong><br />
Even though we start teaching everything from scratch so that beginners can follow, we've packed a lot of information into this course and you'll be learning skills in the bootcamp that will take others years to master on their own. You'll need a lot of self-motivation to be able to complete this course successfully and on-time.</p>
